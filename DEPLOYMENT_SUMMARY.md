# Deployment Configuration Summary

## ✅ Updated Deployment Approach

Since you're using **Upstash Cloud Redis**, the deployment has been optimized to:

### What Was Removed ❌

- ~~`.env` file transfer~~ - Now created dynamically from GitHub Secrets
- ~~`compose.yaml` file transfer~~ - Not needed for cloud Redis

### What's Included ✅

- **JAR file**: `crud-redis-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- **Systemd service**: `spring-boot-crud-redis.service`
- **Dynamic .env creation**: Created on server from GitHub Secrets

## 🔐 Required GitHub Secrets

You need to add **7 secrets** to your GitHub repository:

### Server Credentials (SSH Key Authentication)

1. `SERVER_HOST` = `103.125.181.190`
2. `SERVER_USERNAME` = `destroyer`
3. `SERVER_SSH_KEY` = Your SSH private key content

⚠️ **Important**: Generate SSH keys and add public key to server before deployment. See `GITHUB_SECRETS.md` for detailed
instructions.

### Upstash Redis Credentials

4. `UPSTASH_ENDPOINT` = `UPSTASH_ENDPOINT-muskrat-23212.upstash.io`
5. `UPSTASH_PORT` = `6379`
6. `UPSTASH_USERNAME` = `default`
7. `UPSTASH_PASSWORD` = `UPSTASH_PASSWORD`

## 📋 Automated Deployment Flow

```
1. GitHub Actions triggers on push to main
   ↓
2. Build with Maven (JDK 25)
   ↓
3. Transfer files to server via SCP:
   - crud-redis-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   - spring-boot-crud-redis.service
   - nginx/redis-demo.jvm.my.id.conf
   ↓
4. Deploy Application:
   - Create .env file from GitHub Secrets
   - Update systemd service
   - Start Spring Boot application
   - Verify application status
   ↓
5. Setup Nginx (NEW!):
   - Install Nginx (if not present)
   - Update configuration
   - Test configuration
   - Reload Nginx
   - Configure firewall
   ↓
6. Verify Domain (NEW!):
   - ✓ Test Spring Boot (localhost:8080)
   - ✓ Test Nginx proxy (localhost:80)
   - ✓ Test server IP (103.125.181.190)
   - ✓ Test HTTP domain
   - ✓ Test HTTPS domain
   ↓
7. Deployment Complete! ✅
   Application accessible at:
   - http://103.125.181.190
   - https://redis-demo.jvm.my.id
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### Security Improvements

- ✅ **SSH Key Authentication**: More secure than password-based auth
- ✅ Credentials stored in GitHub Secrets (not in repository)
- ✅ `.env` file created dynamically on server
- ✅ File permissions set to 600 (owner-only access)
- ✅ Private key never exposed during deployment

### Simplified Deployment

- ✅ No local Docker Redis needed
- ✅ No compose.yaml file needed
- ✅ Less files to transfer
- ✅ Cloud-native approach

## 📝 Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate SSH Key Pair

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-deploy" -f ~/.ssh/deploy_key -N ""

# Add public key to server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key.pub destroyer@103.125.181.190

# Test connection
ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key destroyer@103.125.181.190
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets

1. Go to: https://github.com/hendisantika/spring-boot-crud-redis
2. Click: **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click: **New repository secret**
4. Add each of the 7 secrets listed above

For `SERVER_SSH_KEY`, copy the entire private key:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/deploy_key
```

## 🚀 Deploy Your Application

Once secrets are configured:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update deployment configuration for Upstash Cloud"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. ✅ Build your application
2. ✅ Deploy to 103.125.181.190
3. ✅ Create `.env` with Upstash credentials
4. ✅ Start the application
5. ✅ **Setup/update Nginx** (NEW!)
6. ✅ **Verify domain is working** (NEW!)

Access at:

- **Direct**: http://103.125.181.190:8080
- **With Nginx**: https://redis-demo.jvm.my.id (recommended)

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

After deployment, SSH into your server:

```bash
ssh destroyer@103.125.181.190

# Check if .env was created
cat /home/destroyer/spring-boot-crud-redis/.env

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status spring-boot-crud-redis

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u spring-boot-crud-redis -f
```

## 🌐 Nginx Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For production deployment with HTTPS:

1. Configure DNS: `redis-demo.jvm.my.id` → `103.125.181.190`
2. Run setup script: `./setup-nginx.sh`
3. Access via: https://redis-demo.jvm.my.id

See **NGINX_SETUP.md** for details.

## ✨ New Features

### Automated Nginx Setup

The deployment now **automatically**:

- Installs Nginx if not present
- Updates Nginx configuration
- Tests and reloads Nginx
- Configures firewall

### Automated Domain Verification

After each deployment, the workflow **verifies**:

- ✓ Spring Boot backend is running
- ✓ Nginx is serving requests
- ✓ Server is accessible via IP
- ✓ Domain is working (if Cloudflare configured)
- ✓ HTTPS is working (if Cloudflare configured)

See **DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md** for details.
